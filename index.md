<p style="line-height:1.2"><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
안녕하세요! My name is Minho Jeong, and my research interests lie broadly in <i><font color="#34A392">pure mathematics</font></i>. Especially, analytical number theory is fascinating me these days, and I am attempting to prove or disprove the <i><font color="#34A392">Wall-Sun-Sum prime conjecture</font></i>, a.k.a. Fibonacci-Wieferich prime conjecture. When I'm not in the lab, you'll find me on the court playing <i><font color="#34A392">basketball or tennis</font></i>, the perfect escape from everything that keeps me busy. If you'd like to collaborate on research with me, or just shoot some hoops, feel free to hit me up!
