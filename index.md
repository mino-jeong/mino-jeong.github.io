<p style="line-height:1.5"><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
I am Minho Jeong, a senior at Busan Il Science High School</a>, expected to graduate in February 2025. My mathematical research interests lie broadly in pure mathematics. Currently, I am attempting to prove/disprove the Wall-Sun-Sum prime conjecture (also known as Fibonacci-Wieferich prime conjecture).
