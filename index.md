I am Minho Jeong, a senior at <a href="bsis.hs.kr">"Busan Il Science High School</a>, expected to graduate in February 2025. My mathematical research interests lie broadly in pure mathematics. Currently, I am attempting to prove/disprove the Wall-Sun-Sum prime conjecture (also known as Fibonacci-Wieferich prime conjecture).
