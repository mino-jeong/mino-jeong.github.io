<p style="line-height:1.2"><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
안녕하세요! My name is Minho Jeong, and thank you for visiting my page! I'm an avid basketball player and an amateur mathematician with research interests focusing on <strong><a href="https://xkcd.com/435" style="text-decoration-line: none"><font color="#34A392">pure mathematics</font></a></strong>. Currently, I'm attempting to prove or disprove the Wall-Sun-Sun prime conjecture (a.k.a. Fibonacci-Wieferich prime conjecture). If you are interested in my research, or just shoot some hoops, please feel free to contact me!
